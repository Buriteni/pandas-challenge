This data analysis can provide valuable insight into the correlation between district and charter school math and reading scores, as well as how school budgets may affect them. By examining data from various sources such as test scores, student demographics, class sizes, funding levels and other variables related to schoolsâ€™ budgeting decisions we can gain a better understanding of how resources are impacting students' academic performance. Additionally, this information can help inform policy makers in their decision-making process when it comes to allocating educational funds.
This is a small sample size, but based on the data, it appears that charter schools generally have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher percentages of students passing math, and reading overall. Additionally, smaller schools, with smaller class sizes tend to have higher average scores and passing rates than larger schools. This may be the reason why we see charter schools with higher scores.

The resources that I utilized for this were AskBCS, previous class activities, https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_csv.asp, and https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html to get the data and coding for this project.
